The code uses Iced Coffeescript to compile to Javascript.

To compile Iced Coffeescript to be used in node, use vim-coffee-script's CoffeeMake -I or --runtime node.

That command would put this in the head of the file:

iced = require('iced-coffee-script').iced;

else it would complain iced is not found.
